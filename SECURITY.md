## 🛡️ Security Measures

### Current Security Features

#### Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ JWT-based authentication
- ✅ Password hashing with bcrypt (12 salt rounds)
- ✅ Secure session management
- ✅ Token expiration (7 days default)
- ✅ Protected API endpoints

#### Data Protection
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ SQL injection prevention (using Mongoose)
- ✅ XSS protection
- ✅ CSRF protection considerations
- ✅ Secure file upload validation

#### Network Security
- ✅ CORS configuration
- ✅ Helmet.js security headers
- ✅ Rate limiting (100 requests per 15 minutes)
- ✅ HTTPS recommended for production

#### File Security
- ✅ File type validation
- ✅ File size limits (10MB default)
- ✅ Secure file storage
- ✅ Path traversal prevention

### Security Best Practices

#### For Developers
1. **Never commit sensitive data**
   - Use `.env` files for secrets
   - Add `.env` to `.gitignore`
   - Use environment variables

2. **Keep dependencies updated**
   ```bash
   npm audit
   npm audit fix
   ```

3. **Validate all input**
   - Client-side validation
   - Server-side validation
   - Sanitize user input

4. **Use HTTPS in production**
   - Never transmit credentials over HTTP
   - Use secure cookies
   - Enable HSTS

5. **Implement proper error handling**
   - Don't expose stack traces
   - Log errors securely
   - Use generic error messages for users

#### For Users
1. **Use strong passwords**
   - Minimum 8 characters
   - Mix of letters, numbers, symbols
   - Don't reuse passwords

2. **Keep software updated**
   - Update Node.js regularly
   - Update MongoDB regularly
   - Update dependencies

3. **Secure your environment**
   - Protect your `.env` file
   - Use firewall rules
   - Limit database access

4. **Monitor for suspicious activity**
   - Check logs regularly
   - Monitor API usage
   - Review user accounts
